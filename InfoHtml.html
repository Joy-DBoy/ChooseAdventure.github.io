<h1>What Is HTML???</h1>

<br></br>

    <p>

        Let us start off with a brief history on HTML, the first person to produce the concept of HTML was a man by the name of Tim Berners-Lee. He first started working on the HTML software in 1993 but a publish stander was not officially released until 1999. The reasoning behind the HTML software was to allow others to sharing and gathering of information that was readable online. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, this means that this is the coding language used to help structure a web page and the content contained within the page. Another interesting style about HTML is that it works in a down scrolling movement. In HTML we use elements called tags to help us design our web pages, we can layout, measure and fit in information, such as images, text and animations to our web pages using HTML. Some useful and quite common elements used are Margins, Borders and Padding tags these tags all take on a square shape to them. What does this do, well the Margin sets an invisible border around the main web page, or even elements within Div's and box’s and so on. Next the Border tag this sets a border around the web pages, or Div's that contain content, and other elements to give a clean measured out box shape to your web page and other elements like buttons, headings, paragraphs. After you added the Border next you would add padding within the Border again this gives use an invisible border to set around images and other elements within the web page our box's, this measures from the Border towards the content stored inside Div’s, flex box’s and so on.  Another helpful tag that is used all the time and always found in every HTML page is h1 and p tags. The h1 tags are used for headings for text mostly, and the p tag stands for paragraphs like its name you can write paragraphs of text within these tags and when your done filling in your information you can than create a CSS file this stand for Cascading style sheet this file just allows use to style elements like font size, create borders around our text add radius to our border and so on. Another tag that is tremendously important is the a tag this stands for anchor helps us connect other web pages to one another using hyperlinks such as style sheets, even the next page you might go into after clicking on an option on page anything that has URL addresses really. Other common tags are the body tags which all information we implement is stored in between, the head tag just contains other information related to the web page like links and so on. And the last tag we will quickly talk about the HTML tag which all information and tags are stored in between this allows use to make web pages and without it none of this is possible. Pros it is simple to learn, it is free meaning you do not have to pay for it and templates are put in place to help you out at the start if coding is not your thing. Cons security it is not secure on its own meaning you need third party help, static pages meaning if you want more of a dynamic page its harder to do and limited to what you can do alone with html is not enough to get an overall superbly design page.
