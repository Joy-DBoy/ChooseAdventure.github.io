    <p>Our adventure begins in a far distant land that goes by the name of Wano. Our swordsman Zoro is enjoying a little nap in the crow's nest when all a sudden he hears a loud noise below deck. Zoro begins to wake up slowly and than pops his head out to look down below and see what is going on. He notices that all his crew are missing.</p>

<p>For a second Zoro thinks to himself the noise he heard was probably his crew leaving the ship to go to the town of Wano. The ship after all was parked on the coast just south of the city. Zoro decides that he too will leave the ship and try to find his crew. As Zoro jumps off the ship he sees a road that spilts into two different directions neither roads have any signs with direction, where should Zoro go, Left will bring you to page 5 or Right will bring you to page 9??? </p>
