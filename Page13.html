    <p>As Zoro left the old house he carried on his travel through the night until he caught up to his crew reaching the gates in the morning zoro saw his crew and called out to them, all of them waited to greet him before enetering the city of Wano together all as a group. Zoro felt though he was meant to take this adventure on his own so that he could find his new sword almost like it was faith. Thank you for playing the lost swordsman</p>
